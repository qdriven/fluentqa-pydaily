### A Note on this Personal Space

This initial Studio project template was cloned from the [Studio Templates](https://github.com/stoplightio/studio-templates) Github repository. If you find an error, or have an idea on how to improve this getting started template, please let us know in the issues section of that repository.

We plan to add additional sections on Prism (mocking), Spectral (linting), working with the filesystem, Git, and more in the future.

This template includes a couple of example APIs (Petstore and To-dos). You can create a new project, or open another folder on your computer, by clicking the `Project Selector` dropdown in the top left of the Studio UI.

2. **Project Selector:** Click the project selector to switch between projects, add a new project, or open an existing project.
3. **APIs:** Studio scans all of the files in your project, and surfaces the unique API specifications in this list for easy access.
4. **Table of Contents:** One or more tags can be added to articles, HTTP operations, and models. This tree groups design assets together by their first tag.
5. **Primary Panel:** You can switch which mode is shown on the primary panel by clicking the mode selector in the top right.
6. **Secondary Panel:** You can switch which mode is shown on the secondary panel by clicking the mode selector in the top right.
